\usage{
polyline2linestring(line, elevation = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{line}{character - polyline}

\item{elevation}{numeric - vector of elevations}
}
\description{
OTP returns the 2d route as a polyline bean and the elevation profile as vector of numbers
But the number of points for each is not the same, as 2D line only has a point at change of directions
While elevation is regally spaced. If elevation is supplied the correct heights are matched
