For a simple R wrapper for the Open Trip Planner API, please see the repository for the [otpr package](https://github.com/marcusyoung/otpr).

For further development on a fork of this repository, which has evolved into a package that goes beyond purely an API wrapper, for example managing the setup and configuration of OTP instances, see the [ITSLeeds/opentripplanner](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/opentripplanner) repository.
